## I am completed the Interactive Quiz Application Project Using HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT.In that project I added 10 Questions which is based on the Web development. In that project I have created simply the frontend which will contain the Marks obtained to the student who want to practice the quiz and it will show the Corrected answers and incorrected answers while Solving the quiz.While solving the quiz if we select the correct answer then that option will marked in green color and if we select the wrong answer then it will marked in red color which is easily understandable. If the user will not select any option from 4 options then the system gives an alert to select an option. When we select an incorrect option then that time system will give at bottom correct answer and then we can go for next question while clicking on Next Question button.

Project Features
The quiz application begins with a clean and structured interface that displays the quiz title, progress bar, and question counter. As the user starts answering questions, the system dynamically loads each question and its corresponding four answer options from a predefined JavaScript question array.

1. Dynamic Question Loading
    The questions are stored in an array of objects in JavaScript. Each object contains:
    Question text 
    Four options
    Correct answer index    
    Explanation for the answer    
    When the page loads, the first question is displayed automatically. As the user proceeds, the application loads the next question dynamically without refreshing the page.
2. Answer Validation and Color Indication
    When a user selects an answer and clicks the Submit Answer button:
    If the answer is correct, the selected option is highlighted in green.
    If the answer is incorrect, the selected option is highlighted in red, and the correct answer is automatically marked in green. 
    This color-based feedback makes the system easy to understand and visually clear for users.

3. Instant Feedback with Explanation
    After submitting an answer:
    The system displays a feedback message. 
    If correct → “Correct!” message appears.   
    If incorrect → “Incorrect” message appears along with the correct explanation.   
    This helps users understand their mistakes and learn immediately.
4. Alert for No Selection
    If the user clicks the Submit Answer button without selecting any option, the system displays an alert message asking the user to select an answer. This ensures proper validation and prevents accidental submission.
5. Score Tracking System
    The application keeps track of:
    Total correct answers
    Total incorrect answers
    Current score
    Final percentage score
    A live answer indicator at the bottom updates after each question, showing how many answers are correct and incorrect.
6. Progress Bar
   A progress bar visually indicates how many questions have been completed. This improves user experience by giving a sense of progression.
7. Result Section
    After completing all 10 questions:
    The quiz content is hidden.
    A result section appears.
    The final score is displayed (e.g., 8/10).
    Percentage score is calculated.
    A performance-based message is shown such as:
    Perfect Score
    Excellent
    Good Work
    Keep Trying
    This motivational feedback encourages users to improve.
8. Restart Option
    Users can restart the quiz at any time after completion by clicking the Restart Quiz button. This resets all values and loads the quiz from the beginning.
9. Smooth Animations and UI Enhancements
    The CSS includes:
    Slide-in animation for the container
    Fade-in animation for feedback
    Scale animation for the score display
    Hover effects on buttons
    Smooth transitions
    These effects make the application visually attractive and interactive.
